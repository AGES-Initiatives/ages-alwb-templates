Loose, remit and forgive any sins that we have committed during the year that is past, and keep us free from sin in the New Year. Enlighten us with the light of your truth and your divine commandments. Establish in our souls your holy will, and guide us to every work that is good and pleasing to you. Guard well our holy Church with your divine grace. Remember, Lord, our nation; train up the youth; protect the elderly; encourage the faint-hearted; gather the scattered; bring back those who have gone astray, and reunite them to your holy Church. Overshadow our Land with your might, and grant it gentle rain and abundance of the fruits of the earth. Speak of goodness in the hearts of our rulers; support and strengthen them, together with our armed forces by land, sea and air. Let your kingdom come upon us, O Lord; the kingdom of love, goodness, peace and justice; and make us worthy to praise and glorify, with one mouth and one heart, your most honorable and majestic name, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages." //constantinides

For centuries You kept it free, by Your divine grace; and when it was subjugated, You preserved it, and then delivered it and resurrected it to a life of liberty once again. O all-benevolent Master, today as we celebrate the illustrious Bicentennial of the Greek Revolution, that our fathers declared in Your holy name on this festive day of the Annunciation, as they proceeded to fight for faith and country, accept our gratitude and glorification, and hear us as we implore You with faith. We pray for the souls of our fathers and brethren who for our faith and country fought and sacrificed themselves; whether they were slain in battle, hanged or executed, or they died in captivity and adversity, grant them rest together with Your Saints. As for us, grant that we all be worthy of freedom, and preserve us in peace. Maintain all officials and authorities of our Government in peace and concord, and grant stability to both Church and State. For You are the Lord of peace and the Savior of our souls, and to You we send up glory, to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages."

For this reason, Lord, on this day our whole Land is full of praises for You, and in rejoicing and gratitude we cry to You: Make Your paths known to us, O Lord, and teach us Your ways; direct us in Your path and guide all of us, both leaders and people, to Your truth; for many are the enemies surrounding us, but blessed are the people whose helper is the Lord their God. We also pray to You for the souls of our martyred brethren: those who fell in war, those who were slaughtered, and those who died in captivity or exile; may they dwell in blessedness and repose with the righteous; may their bones come to life again as green grass, so that both the living and those who have fallen asleep in the hope of resurrection may raise up a hymn of thanksgiving and doxology to You, the mighty King of the ages, for ever and ever."
