O Master, Who loves mankind, Who for us both died and arose and Who granted us these, Your dread and life-creating Mysteries, for the benefit and sanctification of our souls and bodies: Grant that these may be to me for the healing of both soul and body, for the averting of everything hostile, for the enlightenment of the eyes of my heart, for the peace of the powers of my soul, for faith unashamed, for love unfeigned, for the fullness of wisdom, for the observance of Your commandments, for an increase of Your divine grace, and for abiding in Your Kingdom; that being kept by them in Your holiness I may ever be mindful of Your grace, and no longer live for myself but for You, our Master and benefactor. And thus, when from this life I have passed in the hope of life eternal, may I attain to everlasting rest, where the sound of those who celebrate is unceasing, and unending is the delight of those who behold the ineffable beauty of Your Countenance.

Receive, O my compassionate Christ, their petitions, and make of your hired servant a child of light!
