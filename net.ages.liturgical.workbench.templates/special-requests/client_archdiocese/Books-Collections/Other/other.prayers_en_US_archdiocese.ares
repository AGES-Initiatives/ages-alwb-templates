PandemicPrayer1.text = "Forbearing and merciful, loving and compassionate, Almighty Lord, who brought our nature into being and having fallen once again raised us. Who sent Your only-begotten Son, Savior and Redeemer, and Benefactor healing the passions of body and soul. Do You, forbearing Master, look down upon us and hearken to our entreaty in our day of sorrow. Safeguard us from the coming upon all the earth of the plague-bearing threat. Lord, take away affliction and fear. The darkness of death surrounds us. Remember Your innumerable acts of compassion; reveal to us the depths of Your mercy; do not let us be destroyed because of the multitude of our sins. Hearken unto the voice of our prayer from deep within us as it cries out to You. Do not turn Your face away from us nor turn away from your creatures in wrath. Be our aid and deliverer. O our God and Savior, do not reject or abandon us but come and redeem us. Draw near in Your customary kindness. Crush the power of the illness-bearing plague; disgrace its violence, pain and dejection, transforming it to joy. Preside over calm for humanity. By Your power greatly aid those serving in the field of health. Raise us from our bed of pain and from our bedding of affliction. Grant health to those who have contracted the illness. Give rest in the tentings of the Saints to those who have surrendered their lives to the virus. Grant consolation to their families. For You are the physician of our souls and bodies and to You we offer glory, Father Son and Holy Spirit, now and always and unto ages of ages."
