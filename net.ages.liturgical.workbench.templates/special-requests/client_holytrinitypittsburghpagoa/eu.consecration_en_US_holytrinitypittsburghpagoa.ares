euCON.Key1001.text = "Lord our God, you created all things by your word alone and adorned your creation with diversity in ways unknown to us. You poured forth the light of the sun for its renewal. You inspired your servant Moses to offer exaltations and praises to the excellence of your creation and say: \"You saw the light and it was good and you called it day.\" We have also seen this brilliant sun renewing the creation every day and we glorify you the true light. Lord, by your Son, you have commanded us to renew our nature by your Holy Spirit, and through this gift your just people shine like the sun. We pray and entreat you, Father of the Word, our Lord and our God Jesus Christ, because creation has been renewed by your indescribable love and abundant mercy for us. You manifested your love and mercy in the Old Testament as the image of the New, the miraculous burning bush, the tabernacle of assembly and the beautiful Temple of Solomon. Lord look upon us also, your sinful and unworthy servants with merciful eyes, who worship in this holy house, which is as broad as heaven, the pride of the universe, the true altar of your ineffable glory. Send down on us your most Holy Spirit and in the words of David, \"renew a right spirit within our hearts and make us strong with your sovereign spirit.\" Make the leaders of our nation victorious over visible and invisible enemies and grant us tranquility and peace. Forgive the sins of those who have worked with diligence and love for you toward the erection and consecration of this Church. Fulfill Lord, all their requests which are for their salvation. Help them to perform your commandments. Give them the gift of renewal through your Holy Spirit, that they, without condemnation, may worship you, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you sent, through the prayers of the most Holy Mother of God and all your Saints."

euCON.Key1002.text = "Eternal Word and only Son of God, true God of the material and spiritual creation. You adorned all of creation with divine wisdom. You joined together the fluid and vague nature of water with your Holy Spirit, that moved over the water, and you beautified all the earth and renewed the whole world. You established the Tabernacle through Moses and consecrated it by your Holy Spirit. You inspired Solomon the Wise to erect a Holy Temple, in honor of your indescribable and ineffable glory. You consecrated it by your Holy Spirit and enabled the Judges of Judah at that time to see the glory and the grace of your Holy Spirit hovering over it. We pray and entreat you, at this time, eternal Word, and Son of the eternal Father, send down the same gift of your most Holy Spirit upon us and upon this Church erected for your glory and praise. Establish and strengthen this Church, protecting it to the end of the world. Renew this Church by your Holy Spirit, that as we offer the bloodless sacrifices in it, we might become partakers of your Holy Spirit. Make us sharers in the Holy Spirit, which renews us, upholds us with a willing heart and mystically grants us the cleansing of our mind, that we might offer you, Master, glory and honor, to the eternal Father, the only-begotten Son and the all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages."
