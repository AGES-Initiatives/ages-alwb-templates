Apolytikion
The sound of your teaching has gone out to all the earth, which received your word; divinely you set forth through it your doctrine, and the nature of all things you did reveal. Into good order you have set the ways of men. By your royal priesthood, venerable father, intercede with Christ God that his great mercy may be granted us.
